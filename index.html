        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my research page. My research focuses on the radio 
            and X-ray observations of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) 
            at the center. When SMBHs grow by accreting gas and dust, the gravitational potential energy from the 
            infalling material is converted to radiation, visible at nearly every wavelength as an active galactic nucleus 
            (AGN). A small fraction, known as radio-loud AGNs, are characterized by powerful radio emissions, often 
            associated with extended jets. The vast majority of AGNs, the so-called radio-quiet AGN population, 
            display intermediate or weak radio emissions. An outstanding open question in extragalactic astronomy 
            is the origin of the radio-loud and radio-quiet dichotomy. Recent radio studies based on large samples 
            of strong X-ray-emitting AGNs found that the radio-quiet sources are about 10 million times less luminous 
            than the most powerful radio-loud AGNs. To help understand the origin of radio emission from radio-quiet 
            sources, I investigate the radio properties of a volume-complete sample of local AGNs using sensitive, 
            high-angular resolution observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). I am currently working on 
            the Fundamental Reference AGN Monitoring Experiment (FRAMEx), an international collaborative survey project, 
            under the Radio Reference Frame Division at the United States Naval Observatory, Washington, DC.</p>
